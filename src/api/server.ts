	// Health checks.
	// What: two paths that return the same payload. Root /health is the
	//   classic platform probe (Railway/Render watchdogs hit this). /api/health
	//   exists so the dashboard's plugin proxy — which prepends /api to every
	//   forwarded path — can reach it without the bot having to special-case
	//   the "health" wildcard on the proxy side.
	// Who: Railway/Render deploy infra hits /health. The Company Uno plugin
	//   proxy (forwardToBot.ts) hits /api/health when PluginSettings's Test
	//   Connection button calls checkHealth().
	// When: on deploy boot loop + on every owner-initiated Test Connection click.
	// Where: mounted BEFORE verifySignature so neither path requires an HMAC
	//   signature or API key. Health is public by design — returning "ok" from
	//   an unauthenticated probe leaks nothing, and requiring a signature would
	//   defeat the whole point of a liveness check.
	// How: one shared handler, two mount points. Keep the body identical so
	//   downstream consumers do not need to branch on which URL they hit.
