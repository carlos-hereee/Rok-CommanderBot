// ── /api/pairing/redeem (FUTURE_PLANS item 63, Phase 2) ────────────────
// What:  exchanges a one-time pairing code (issued + DM'd to the guild owner
//        on guildCreate in Phase 1) for the guildId + ownerUserId the code
//        was issued for. The platform server uses the returned guildId to
//        bind this Discord guild into the user's pluginConfig.
// Who:   nexious-server's plugin-proxy forwards the dashboard's "Claim
//        server" form POST to this endpoint. No other caller. The signed
//        proxy is the only entry point because verifySignature gates every
//        /api/* route — there is no Discord-side redemption surface by
//        design (the binding has to land in the platform's pluginConfig,
//        which the bot does not own).
// When:  every successful paste of a claim code into the Company Uno
//        dashboard's plugin panel.
// Where: mounted at /api/pairing under verifySignature in server.ts.
//        Deliberately does NOT carry a ?guildId= query param because the
//        code IS the discriminator — the platform server does not know
//        which guild the code came from until this endpoint tells it.
// How:
//   ① Validate body.code is a non-empty string (400 otherwise). The store
//      handles trim + uppercase normalization, so we pass the raw input
//      through. Empty/whitespace is rejected here because the store would
//      end up running findOneAndUpdate with code:"" which a future schema
//      change could match in unexpected ways.
//   ② Call pendingPairingStore.redeem. The store collapses invalid,
//      expired, and already-consumed into a single null return — deliberate
//      so this endpoint is not an oracle a probing attacker can use to
//      distinguish "code does not exist" from "code is in use." We mirror
//      the collapse with a single 410 Gone response shape for every miss.
//      410 (not 404) because the resource-semantically-existed-but-is-no-
//      longer-redeemable framing fits "expired or consumed" more honestly
//      than the generic "not found."
//   ③ Log PAIRING_REDEEMED via botLogStore. CRITICAL: this log must not
//      block or fail the response. Once redeem returns a doc the code is
//      already atomically consumed (single-use). If we returned 500 on a
//      log failure the platform would retry, get a 410 on the now-consumed
//      code, and never learn the guildId — the code becomes a black hole
//      and the user sees "claim failed" even though the bind data exists.
//      So we try/catch the log call locally and degrade analytics rather
//      than redemption. Metadata key is `ownerId` (not ownerUserId) so it
//      joins cleanly to PAIRING_CODE_SENT's `{ ownerId }` for funnel
//      queries — same shape across both events even though the underlying
//      model field is named `ownerUserId`.
//   ④ Return { data: { guildId, ownerUserId, consumedAt } }. consumedAt
//      lets the platform server stamp the bind row with the moment of
//      redemption without a second round trip. Envelope shape matches the
//      autoHeal/events route convention.
//   ⑤ A 500 wraps any unexpected redeem throw so a Mongo blip surfaces as
//      a transient retryable failure rather than leaking the underlying
//      error to the dashboard. The signed-proxy caller logs the bot-side
//      detail server-side; we keep the body sparse here. A redeem throw
//      is safe to retry: findOneAndUpdate is atomic, so either the code
//      was consumed (next call returns 410, never a double-bind) or it
//      was not consumed (next call succeeds).
