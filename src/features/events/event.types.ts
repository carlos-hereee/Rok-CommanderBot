	// fields as truly optional in the inferred document type, and every read site
	// treats undefined and null identically as "no image".

	// leave it null and never auto archive. ReminderScheduler and
	// ScheduleBoard guard with truthy checks before reading it.
	//
	// The `?` (optional property) is required, not just `| undefined`.
	// Mongoose's inferred document type marks the field as truly optional
	// when the schema sets `required: false`, and TypeScript distinguishes
	// `T | undefined` (required prop, may be undefined) from `T?` (prop
	// may be absent). Without `?` here every Mongoose-typed event flowing
	// into a function that takes IGameEvent fails with TS2345

	// undefined the same as null at every read site — there is no
	// semantic difference between "field absent" and "field explicitly null".

	// accidentally reintroducing a channel picker on the event form.

	// Same `?` reasoning as seasonEnd above: Mongoose's inferred document
	// type marks `required: false` fields as truly optional (T?), so the
	// interface must use `?` not `| undefined` or call sites that read a
	// freshly fetched document fail with TS2345. ReminderJob and
	// TestReminderJob both treat undefined and null identically and fall
	// back to GuildConfig.memberRoleId.
	mentionRoleId?: string | null;
	// Pause flag — when true, ReminderScheduler skips this event on every
	// cron tick. Same `?` + `| null` shape as seasonEnd / mentionRoleId /
	// pausedUntil: Mongoose infers `required: false, default: false` as
	// `boolean | null | undefined`, and TypeScript will not assign that
	// to a plain `boolean`. Treat falsy (false, null, undefined) as "not
	// paused" at every call site — the schema default writes `false` on
	// creation, legacy rows load as `undefined`, and /continue-schedule
	// explicitly writes `false`, so the three states are semantically
	// identical.
	paused?: boolean | null;
	// Optional auto-resume timestamp paired with paused:true. Same `?`
	// reasoning as seasonEnd / mentionRoleId — Mongoose marks
	// `required:false` fields as truly optional in the inferred document
	// type. Null means "paused indefinitely". ReminderScheduler clears
	// both paused and pausedUntil when this date passes.
