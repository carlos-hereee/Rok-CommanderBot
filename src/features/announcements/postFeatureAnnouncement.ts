// ── postFeatureAnnouncement ──────────────────────────────────────────
// What:  once per (guild, version) broadcast posted on bot boot. Two
//        surfaces per guild: #announcements (public, godly voice) and
//        #inner-sanctum (admin, plain voice, no ping). Copy lives in
//        each pack's featureAnnouncement block (resolved per guild via
//        getPluginCopy) and is keyed by the bot's
//        current package.json version; idempotency is enforced via
//        botLogStore with a `feature_announced:<version>` event key
//        so every new release gets its own bucket.
// Who:   called once at the tail of main.ts's ClientReady boot loop,
//        after ensureHomebase, refreshIntroEmbeds, and
//        refreshAllSchedules have finished. No other caller.
// When:  every boot. Most boots are no-ops (every guild has already
//        logged this version). Only the first boot after a deploy
//        actually posts anything.
// Where: reads the bot's version by resolving ../../../package.json
//        relative to the COMPILED module location in dist/. The
//        postinstall tsc-alias step does not rewrite relative paths,
//        so we build the path from import.meta.url at runtime.
// How:   ① load package.json version once (cheap, synchronous, runs
//           only on ClientReady);
//        ② iterate cached guilds sequentially so one guild's Discord
//           hiccup cannot stall the rest;
//        ③ for each guild: skip if setupComplete is false (new guilds
//           see the intro embed instead). skip if the version has
//           already been logged. otherwise post public + inner-sanctum
//           and log success.
//        ④ failures on either post are swallowed with a log. the
//           botLogStore write only fires after BOTH posts succeed so
//           a partial failure re-attempts next boot.
