// ── leaderboard channel handlers ──────────────────────────────────────
// What:  persistent button handlers that follow up the
//        /configure-leaderboard-tracking flow with optional channel-
//        lifecycle actions. When the admin turns tracking OFF, the
//        command's reply includes a "Remove leaderboard channel" button.
//        Clicking that button routes here.
// Who:   one handler per button prefix. Today: `lb-ch-del` for
//        "delete the leaderboard channel." Future variants (e.g.,
//        rebuild-now) can register additional prefixes from this module.
// When:  click time. The button persists indefinitely on the original
//        reply, so this handler must not assume the toggle is still off
//        — the admin could have re-enabled tracking in between. Re-read
//        GuildConfig at handler entry to make a fresh decision.
// Where: customId format is `lb-ch-del:<guildId>`. The guildId is
//        included as positional arg so a stale message from a different
//        guild cannot cross-fire if a bot ever shares messages between
//        guilds (it currently does not, but the explicit guildId is a
//        cheap sanity check).
// How:   ① guard guildId presence + match against the button arg;
//        ② Administrator permission check (same gate as the slash
//           command that produced the button);
//        ③ load GuildConfig, locate the leaderboard channel by stored
//           id, delete it via Discord API;
//        ④ clear GuildConfig.leaderboardChannelId so a future toggle-on
//           with autoHealEnabled can rebuild it cleanly;
//        ⑤ reply with confirmation + a hint about how to restore.

// file does not need to know the format string — it just calls this helper.
