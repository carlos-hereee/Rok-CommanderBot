// Platform-research polls broadcast to every eligible guild by PollDispatcher.
// This is voice-neutral platform content, NOT guild pack voice — the same
// category as the ops/outage messages that deliberately live outside the copy
// packs. The question is a factual behavior probe, identical in every guild
// regardless of pluginId, so it does not get a per-pack phrasing.
//
// Each poll is dispatched at most once per guild (idempotent via the
// poll_sent:<pollId> bot-log key), so pollId MUST stay stable once shipped:
// changing it would re-broadcast to every guild. pollId and option keys MUST
// NOT contain ":" — it is the customId delimiter the interactionRegistry splits
// on (customId is `poll:<pollId>:<optionKey>`).

// ACTIVE_POLLS once these results are in).

// Polls the dispatcher broadcasts on boot. PARKED as of 2026-06-18: the boot-
// dispatched audience poll is shelved (the owner is reconsidering polls in favor
// of a future /poll slash command, possibly in a dedicated channel). The
// dispatcher framework stays in place but dormant — an empty list means
// dispatchPolls posts nothing and logPollTallies logs nothing. INTRO_AWARENESS_POLL
// above is retained for reference / reuse when the /poll work resumes. Re-adding a
// definition here is safe: the poll_sent bot-log keys keep already-asked guilds
// from being re-prompted.
