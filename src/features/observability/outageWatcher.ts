// ── outageWatcher ──
// What: polls serverApi's reachability state on a 60-second tick. When the bot
//   has been failing to reach nexious-server continuously for 5 minutes, DMs
//   the platform owner once. When the server becomes reachable again after a
//   notice was already sent, DMs a recovery notice once. Idempotent — does not
//   spam the owner during a long outage, does not send duplicate recovery
//   notices on a flapping outage.
// Who: registered from main.ts after the Discord client is ready. Reads
//   serverApi.getServerReachabilityState() (no direct coupling to the request
//   path) and creatorId from config (the platform owner's Discord user ID).
// When: every 60 seconds for the lifetime of the process. Cheap — one read of
//   in-memory state plus a comparison. The DM only fires on threshold crossing.
// Where: lives in features/observability/ alongside any future ops-side code
//   (latency alerts, fire-rate alerts, etc). Fire-and-forget; failures DMing
//   the owner are logged and swallowed because there is no higher escalation
//   path inside the bot.
// How:
//   ① On every tick read the reachability state from serverApi.
//   ② If currentlyFailing AND failureDurationMs >= threshold AND we have not
//      already sent a notice for this outage → send the outage DM, mark
//      noticeFiredAt = now.
//   ③ If NOT currentlyFailing AND a notice was previously sent (noticeFiredAt
//      is set) → send the recovery DM, clear noticeFiredAt.
//   ④ Otherwise no-op. Most ticks are no-ops because the server is reachable.

// The threshold is deliberately generous. A short outage (Heroku slow-warming
// after sleep, transient DNS hiccup) should NOT page the owner. Five minutes
// is long enough that anything tripping it is real, short enough that the
// owner can act before the cron tick falls behind on a meaningful number of
// reminders.
const OUTAGE_THRESHOLD_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000;

// Tick cadence. 60s matches the bot's other periodic work (cron tick, cache
// TTL) so we never miss a state transition by more than one cycle.
const TICK_INTERVAL_MS = 60 * 1000;

// In-memory record of when we last DM'd the owner about an outage. Null means
// "no notice currently outstanding." Set to a timestamp when a notice fires;
// cleared when recovery fires. Survives only as long as the process — a bot
// restart resets the outage state to "no notice outstanding," which is the
// right behavior because the owner already knows the bot is up if it just
// restarted.
let noticeFiredAt: number | null = null;

// Public so tests (or a future /metrics endpoint) can introspect the watcher
// state without poking module internals.
