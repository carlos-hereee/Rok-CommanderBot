// ── serverHealthNotifier ──
// What: trips an owner-DM notice after the bot has been failing to reach the
//   nexious-server continuously for 5 minutes. Resets when a call succeeds.
//   Mirrors the M9.3 ops posture in the bot CLAUDE.md.
// Who: called once per call attempt by callers that want this behavior. The
//   scheduler's per-guild fetch is the primary call site — every cron tick
//   either succeeds or fails, and the notifier accumulates across ticks.
// When: the owner gets at most ONE DM per outage. The flag stays set until
//   `noteSuccess()` is called, then the next outage can re-trip.
// Where: pure module-state. Not persisted across bot restarts (a restart resets
//   the timer, which is the right behavior — if the bot restarted, the outage
//   may have just been the bot itself).
// How:
//   ① noteFailure(err) records the first failure timestamp if not already set.
//      If 5 minutes have elapsed since that timestamp AND we have not yet
//      sent a notice for this outage, DM the creator.
//   ② noteSuccess() clears all state so the next failure starts a fresh timer.
//   ③ Errors that aren't ServerUnreachableError don't count — those are 4xx
//      validation issues and should not page the owner.
