//        moment, before any edits), look up an EventOverride keyed on that
//        moment and return a merged event payload + the effective fire
//        moment. When no override exists the function returns the event
//        and occurrence verbatim.
// Who:   called from the per-event loop in startScheduler before computing
//        reminderTime and before the dedup check. fireReminder receives the
//        MERGED event so its embed renders the override values; the dedup
//        check still uses the ORIGINAL occurrence so an override applied
//        between cron ticks does not bypass already-fired reminders.
// When:  per event per cron tick. One Mongo findOne per event per tick;
//        with N guilds × M events per guild this is N*M reads per minute,
//        a load the underlying compound unique index handles trivially.
