	// ⑨ refresh the pinned leaderboard board so this week's standings reflect

	// the two refreshes above — a Discord hiccup here must not undo the
	// successful reminder fire.

/*

**Why the DB write happens last:**

The order here is intentional — post to Discord first, then write to DB.
If you did it in reverse and the Discord post failed, you'd have a DB record
saying the reminder fired when it never did, and the duplicate check would
block it from ever retrying. Failing fast before writing means a failed post
is always retryable on the next cron tick.

**Why Discord timestamps (`<t:...:F>`):**

Discord renders `<t:UNIX_TIMESTAMP:F>` in each user's own local timezone automatically.
So a Spanish speaker and an Arabic speaker in different timezones both see the event time
correctly without you doing any timezone math.

## The full picture as one sequence

ClientReady fires

      ▼
startScheduler(client)
      │
      ▼  every 60 seconds
cron.schedule ticks
      │
      ▼
eventStore.findByGuildId(g)   ← what events exist? (per-guild, Future-A safe)
      │
      ▼
getUpcomingOccurrences()      ← when is the next one? (pure math, no DB)
      │
      ▼
diff within fire window?
      ├── NO  → skip, wait for next tick
      └── YES ▼

reminderStore.exists()        ← did we already fire this one?
      ├── YES → skip (duplicate protection)
      └── NO  ▼

fireReminder()
      ├── resolve channel from GuildConfig.announcementsChannelId
      ├── build embed
      ├── post message with role ping + react ✅
      └── reminderStore.create() ← write LAST, so failures are retryable
