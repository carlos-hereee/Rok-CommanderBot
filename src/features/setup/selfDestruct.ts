// ── Self destruct ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Server-owner-only homebase teardown. Demolishes the bot's category and every
// homebase channel in the guild it is invoked in, then sets
// GuildConfig.homebaseDestroyed so the boot sweep (ensureHomebase) and the
// realtime ChannelDeleteWatcher both STOP rebuilding it. The homebase stays gone
// across restarts until /setup runs again (which rebuilds it and re-assigns
// roles). Built for dev testing of the setup/auto-heal path; safe in production
// because it is owner-only and confirmation-gated.
//
// Two entry points both pop the SAME ephemeral Confirm/Cancel prompt: the
// /self-destruct slash command, and an owner-only "Self destruct" button on the
// admin command guide (pinned in the admin command channel). The teardown only
// runs on an explicit Confirm, with an owner re-check at confirm time.
//
// customId scheme `self_destruct:<action>` (prompt | confirm | cancel), routed on
// the "self_destruct" prefix via interactionRegistry. The "Self destruct" button
// folded into the admin command guide row uses `self_destruct:prompt`, which
// handleSelfDestruct turns into the Confirm/Cancel prompt; confirm/cancel use the
// same prefix. (It is NOT a powerup-prefixed control — PowerUps does not delegate here.)
