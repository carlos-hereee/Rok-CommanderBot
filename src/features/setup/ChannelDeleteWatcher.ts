// ── ChannelDeleteWatcher ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// What:  realtime single channel self heal. Subscribes to the Discord
//        gateway `channelDelete` event and rebuilds a homebase channel the
//        moment it is deleted. Complements the boot sweep inside
//        GuildSetupManager.ensureHomebase; see CLAUDE.md for the full self
//        heal story.
// Who:   registered once per process, from main.ts inside the ready handler
//        alongside startScheduler / registerActivityListeners / startApiServer.
//        Consumed by every guild the bot is in because Discord pushes
//        channelDelete events over the gateway connection we already have
//        open for slash commands and reminders.
// When:  fires when Discord reports a channel deletion. Cooldown guard below
//        bails out if a repair for the same guild + channel field happened
//        within the last 60s so a runaway delete/create loop cannot pound
//        Mongo or Discord's REST API.
// Where: delegates all rebuild mechanics to GuildSetupManager.repairOneChannel
//        so the boot sweep and the realtime path share one primitive. The
//        only logic that is unique to this module is the cooldown, the
//        spec lookup by channel id, and the category-gone short circuit.
// How:   ① filter non guild / DM / thread channels (typing narrow).
//        ② load GuildConfig. If none, not our guild, ignore.
//        ③ match the deleted channel id against CHANNEL_SPECS. If nothing
//           matches, the deleted channel is not a homebase channel and we
//           ignore it. If the category itself was deleted, ignore (boot
//           sweep owns full rebuilds).
//        ④ consult cooldown map. if throttled, log + bail.
//        ⑤ verify the category is still alive in Discord. If not, bail
//           and let ensureHomebase handle the full rebuild on next wake.
//        ⑥ run the ownership probe to refuse posting into a foreign
//           homebase. this is the same probe ensureHomebase uses on boot.
//        ⑦ delegate to GuildSetupManager.repairOneChannel, then call
//           GuildSetupManager.postRepairNotices for the single repaired
//           channel so the inner sanctum gets the audit line.
//        Errors after the cooldown gate are logged and swallowed — the
//        gateway connection must never crash because of a repair fault.

// ── cooldown map ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Key format: `${guildId}:${configField}`. configField is the GuildConfig
// key (e.g. "introChannelId") rather than the live channel id because the
// id changes on every rebuild and we need the cooldown to persist across
// the rebuild to catch thrash.
// Value: epoch millis of the last successful repair for that slot.
// Scope: module local Map. in memory only. on process restart the boot
// sweep handles whatever happened while we were down, so losing cooldown
// state on restart is acceptable.
