// ── Discord Onboarding compatibility (FUTURE_PLANS item 35) ─────────
// When a guild has Discord Onboarding enabled (Community Server feature),
// new members only see channels that the admin has added to the
// "Default Channels" list. Channels outside the default list stay
// hidden until the member opts in via Channels & Roles. If our homebase
// category is not in defaults, new members never discover the bot and
// the introductions / announcements / leaderboard channels are
// effectively dead for them.
//
// This helper checks the onboarding state and DMs the guild owner once
// with instructions to add the homebase category to defaults. It is
// idempotent via the ONBOARDING_HEADSUP_SENT log key — every restart
// re-checks but only DMs the first time. If the owner ignores the DM,
// silence is the correct outcome rather than nagging on every deploy.
//
// Called from two places in main.ts:
//   - guildCreate handler, after autoSetup succeeds (new installs)
//   - ClientReady boot sweep, after ensureHomebase (existing guilds
//     paired before this feature shipped)
//
// All failures are swallowed. Onboarding readability is operational
// hygiene, not load-bearing for bot function — a guild without the
// DM still has a perfectly working bot, just one its new members
// cannot find by accident.
