	// What: build the channel permission overwrite that grants this bot
	//       the perms it needs on a private/restricted channel. Without
	//       this overwrite, an `@everyone deny ViewChannel` (or any
	//       channel-level deny on a guild-wide perm) propagates to the
	//       bot via @everyone-role membership and overrides the bot's
	//       integration-role allows. Symptom: DiscordAPIError 50013 on
	//       the very next operation against the channel — eg. creating
	//       a child under a private category, posting an intro embed,
	//       pinning the schedule board, etc.
	// Who:   autoSetup (category overwrites), createChannels (every
	//        public + admin child), buildSingleChannel (repair flow).
	// When:  every time we mint a category or channel for the homebase,
	//        regardless of public/admin kind. The cost is one extra
	//        overwrite entry per channel — cheap insurance against
	//        Discord's permission resolution model biting us.
	// Where: relies on `guild.client.user.id`. The client is logged in
	//        before guildCreate fires (login completes in main.ts step
	//        5), so `client.user` is always populated when we reach
	//        this code path. We avoid `guild.members.me` because the
	//        member cache may not be populated on the very first tick
	//        of guildCreate, but the User object on the Client is.
	// How:   member-level overwrite on the bot's user id. In Discord's
	//        channel permission resolution order, member overwrites
	//        apply LAST (after @everyone, then role overwrites), so a
	//        member allow beats any role-tier deny. We list every perm
	//        the bot uses against any homebase channel — view, send,
	//        embed, history, manage messages, manage channels, manage
	//        roles, add reactions, mention everyone — so a single
	//        overwrite shape works for category, public, and admin
	//        channels alike.

	// ── Phase 1: auto-construct on join / restart ─────────────

	// Who:  called from guildCreate in main.ts (first time the bot joins a
	//       guild) and from ensureHomebase when a rebuild is warranted.
	// When: once per guild per lifecycle of this bot installation, unless
	//       the caller sets options.force.
	// How:  the early return guard skips the build when an existing
	//       GuildConfig row for this guildId is found, UNLESS force is set.
	//       The force flag is the escape hatch ensureHomebase uses when it
	//       has already determined the stored row is foreign (owned by a
	//       different bot) — in that case we must proceed and build our own
	//       homebase without touching the foreign row. Schema has a unique
	//       index on guildId, so if the foreign row is still in the same
	//       collection the create call will throw a duplicate key error.
	//       We log that loudly and bail rather than silently corrupting
	//       anything. Expectation is that the operator runs dev and prod
	//       against separate MongoDB clusters; this guard is defense in
	//       depth against a misconfigured MONGOOSE_URI.
	// Per-guild mutex for autoSetup. Parallel calls for the same guildId both
	// pass the early-return check below before either persists, so both create
	// Discord channels and only one wins the unique-index race — leaving an
	// orphaned duplicate category (hit this 2026-05-05 on first join to a new
	// test server). The mutex caches the first call's promise so a second call
	// returns the same work instead of starting a parallel run. Single-process

		//        (Discord shows any category that has at least one visible

		//        everyone anyway). It was also actively harmful: it
		//        clobbered the bot's own ViewChannel inheritance via
		//        @everyone-role membership and triggered 50013 either
		//        on child creation (when no bot overwrite was present)
		//        or on the category create itself (when a bot member
		//        overwrite tried to escalate ManageRoles/ManageChannels

	// ── intro embed refresh on boot ──────────────────────────────
	// What:  for each of the six homebase channels, edit the stored intro
	//        message in place so a restarted bot ships updated copy from
	//        the copy packs (@base/copy/packs) without forcing the operator to rebuild the
	//        homebase. If the stored message is missing, repost a fresh
	//        intro and persist the new id.
	// Who:   main.ts calls this inside the Events.ClientReady handler once
	//        per guild, AFTER ensureHomebase has run (so we never edit a
	//        channel that is about to be rebuilt).
	// When:  once per guild per process boot. Returns a summary so the
	//        caller can log aggregate numbers without knowing the per channel
	//        branches.
	// Where: paired with populateChannels. populateChannels writes the ids,
	//        refreshIntroEmbeds reads them and either edits or reposts.
	// How:   ① read fresh GuildConfig. bail if missing (ensureHomebase will
	//           have caught this already).
	//        ② for each spec, look up the stored message id under
	//           introMessageIds[spec.configField]. if null → no anchor yet
	//           (legacy row built before this field existed). treat like
	//           "stored message deleted" and repost a fresh intro.
	//        ③ fetch the channel and the message. on Discord 10008 (Unknown
	//           Message) or 10003 (Unknown Channel), repost + persist.
	//        ④ on 50005 (Cannot edit message authored by another user), we
	//           do NOT repost. That error means our stored id points at a
	//           foreign message — corruption case; leave it for the next
	//           ensureHomebase pass to sort out.
	//        ⑤ edit in place with the current embed. swallow transient
	//           errors (rate limit, outage) so one bad channel does not
	//           block the other five.
