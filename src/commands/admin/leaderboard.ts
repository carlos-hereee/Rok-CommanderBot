// ── /leaderboard ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// What:  show participation rankings for an event or across every event
//        the guild has run. Replaces the legacy "type an event id by hand"
//        UX with an autocomplete dropdown that lists every event by name
//        and offers an "All time" option at the top.
// Who:   any member of the guild. Reads only — never mutates the activity
//        store. Not admin-gated because mortals viewing their own
//        ranking is the whole point of a leaderboard.
// When:  on demand. Future enhancement: a LeaderboardBoard module will
//        auto-post / auto-refresh in the leaderboard channel so members
//        do not have to type this command every time they want to check
//        standings. Captured as FUTURE_PLANS 11e.
// Where: this command is the only data surface for live leaderboard
//        views until LeaderboardBoard lands.
// How:   ① autocomplete on `event` lists every event by name + sentinel
//           "All time" as the first option;
//        ② execute branches on the sentinel: all-time path aggregates
//           across every event the guild owns; per-event path scopes to
//           one event. Both paths use the server-side aggregation in
//           activityStore.findAllGroupedByPlayerInEvents so the rendering
//           logic below is identical between branches.

// Sentinel values for the three guild-wide views. Picked underscore-fenced
// strings so they are impossible to collide with a real eventId (those are
// v4 uuids). All-time is the broadest; This month and This week narrow the
// aggregation window by eventOccurrence so streamers can see "how is my
// stream community ranking THIS week" without scrolling past every event
// they have ever run.

// because the bot's existing day-of-week constants (DAYS_OF_WEEK in the
// dashboard's EventCreatePage) treat Sunday as day 0. Streamers can think of
// "this week" as Sunday through Saturday.
