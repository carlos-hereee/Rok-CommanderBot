// ── retention NOTE (deliberately no TTL) ──────────────────────────────
// Unlike ReminderLog, PlayerActivity is NOT throwaway dedup state — it is the
// historical record the /leaderboard command and the dashboard read back
// (all-time, month, week views). A blind TTL here would silently delete a
// guild's leaderboard history, which is destructive and not ours to decide.
// The collection does grow unbounded (one row per player per event
// occurrence), so a retention policy IS eventually needed, but it has to be an
// owner decision: pick a window (e.g. keep 12 months, or roll older rows into
// a per-player aggregate) and add a guarded cleanup job. Tracked as audit item
// H7. Until then this stays append-only on purpose. The { eventId,
// eventOccurrence } prefix of the index above is what a future pruner would
// range-scan on, so no extra index is needed to support cleanup later.
