// ── COPY_PACKS — plugin → pack registry ──────────────────────────────────
// What:  the runtime registry that maps a `pluginId` to the matching copy
//        pack. `getPluginCopy` reads this when resolving a guild's voice.
// Who:   every embed builder, slash command response, and channel intro
//        eventually pulls its copy from a pack picked up here.
// When:  resolved on every render. Modules import `COPY_PACKS` once at
//        boot and the registry is frozen for the rest of the process.
// Where: lives at `@base/copy/packs` (one folder up from `packs/`, the
//        directory that holds the actual pack files). The split keeps a
//        clean import path: pack files import from siblings under
//        `./packs/`, the registry imports from `./packs/<id>.pack.js`,
//        and consumers import the registry from `@base/copy/packs`.
// How:   declared as `Partial<Record<PluginId, IPluginCopy>>` because the
//        `PluginId` union may name plugins whose pack files have not been
//        authored yet (e.g. `general-events` lands in Phase 2 of the
//        streamer-plugin spec). Missing entries are handled by the
//        fallback inside `getPluginCopy` rather than failing loudly at
//        import time. This lets Phase 1 ship the architecture without
//        forcing the Phase 2 stub to land in the same change.

	// "[unused in this plugin]" sentinels so any code path that leaks ROK config flow
	// into a general-events guild surfaces the bug loudly instead of rendering empty
	// content. See packs/general-events.pack.ts for the pack body.

// pluginId resolve to" should read this constant instead of hard-coding
// the literal — that way a future renaming or default change is a single-
// file edit.
