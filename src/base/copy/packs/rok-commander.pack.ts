// ── ROK Commander copy pack ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// What:  the canonical "kingdom voice" copy for the original ROK Commander
//        plugin. Every static and templated string the bot renders for a
//        guild whose `GuildConfig.pluginId === "rok-commander"` (or null,
//        which the lookup treats as the back-compat default) is sourced
//        from this object.
// Who:   the legacy `embedContent` shim has been retired. Call sites now
//        resolve copy through `getPluginCopy(guildConfig)` from
//        `@base/copy/getCopy` (which honors `pluginId` and routes the right
//        pack at runtime), or import `rokCommanderCopy` / the brand constants
//        from `@base/copy/brand` directly when they need this pack specifically.
// When:  every embed, slash command response, and channel intro that has
//        ROK-flavored copy reads from this object. Per-guild owner overrides
//        (Phase 3 of the streamer plugin spec) layer on top via
//        `getCopyOverride(key, guildConfig)` before falling back here.
// Where: this file is the SHAPE of `IPluginCopy`. Sibling packs (general-events
//        for the streamer plugin, neutral pack later, etc.) must satisfy the
//        same shape so callers stay polymorphic.
// How:   moved verbatim from the previous `embed-content.ts` location with
//        zero copy edits. The file split is the architectural change; the
//        words shipped to mortals are unchanged so this can land without
//        any visual diff in Discord.

	//        bot's package.json version, idempotent via botLogStore.
	// Who:   postFeatureAnnouncement reads this, once per (guild, version).
	// When:  on boot, after ensureHomebase + refreshIntroEmbeds +
	//        refreshAllSchedules, so everything else is settled before
	//        we broadcast. New guilds (setupComplete:false) are skipped
	//        — their intro embed tells them what the bot does; they do
	//        not need a "what's new" for features already live.
	// Where: copy lives here so a release-day edit is a one file change.

	//        a new version; they describe the same release in two voices.
