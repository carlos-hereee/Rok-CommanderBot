// ── general-events copy pack (streamer-plugin spec Phase 2 scaffold) ─────
// What:  the plain-English / streamer-tone alternative to rok-commander.
//        Used for any guild whose `GuildConfig.pluginId === "general-events"`.
//        Same shape as rok-commander.pack.ts so callers stay polymorphic;
//        only the words shipped to mortals change.
// Who:   community / streamer servers that want event reminders without the
//        medieval ROK roleplay voice. The first user is the streamer who
//        prompted the streamer-plugin spec; subsequent installs route here
//        via `setAppPlugin` on the dashboard.
// When:  every embed builder and slash command response that already calls
//        `getPluginCopy(guildConfig)` pulls from this pack when the guild
//        opted into "general-events". Per-guild copy overrides via
//        `getCopyOverride` still layer on top — owners who want to nudge a
//        single string can do so without forking the pack.
// Where: lives at `@base/copy/packs/general-events.pack`. Registered in
//        `@base/copy/packs.ts` COPY_PACKS so the runtime resolver finds it.
//        AVAILABLE_PLUGINS in the dashboard's PluginsContainer + PluginShell
//        MANIFEST_REGISTRY + nexious-server PLUGIN_REGISTRY all need to know
//        about "general-events" for the full end-to-end scaffold to work.
// How:   genuinely ROK-only keys (kvkConfirmation, configureReminders,
//        seasonEnd public surface, kvkConfigured response) are stubbed with
//        "[unused in this plugin]" sentinels per spec recommendation. If the
//        bot ever routes a general-events guild through a ROK-only code path
//        the user-visible string surfaces the bug loudly instead of silently
//        rendering empty content. The streamer-tone blocks that already
//        existed inside rok-commander (`streamSchedule`, `pauseSchedule`,
//        `goLiveSoon`, `announceStream`) are reproduced verbatim — they were
//        authored in plain voice from day one and no rewrite is needed.
