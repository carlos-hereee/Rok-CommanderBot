	// ── feature announcement idempotency ──────────────────────────
	// What:  per-guild log that a specific version's feature announcement
	//        has already been posted. The log `event` string is composed
	//        at call time as `feature_announced:<version>` so each release
	//        gets its own bucket. Querying botLogStore.has(guildId,
	//        "feature_announced:1.2.4") tells us whether this guild has
	//        already seen the 1.2.4 announcement.
	// Who:   postFeatureAnnouncement reads + writes. No other caller.
	// When:  read once per boot per guild; written once per successful
	//        public + inner-sanctum post pair.
	// Where: lives in the same BotLog collection as INTRO_DM_SENT so
	//        the idempotency model is consistent across features.
	// How:   prefix constant here + template helper below keeps call
	//        sites symmetric and grep-able. Concatenating the version in
	//        the event string avoids adding a new schema field for
	//        lastAnnouncedVersion.

	// ── auto-leave (v1.5.1 item 9, 2026-05-12) ─────────────────────
	// Logged once per guild when the bot decides to leave a guild it
	// cannot serve because category creation kept failing with
	// DiscordAPIError 50013 (Missing Permissions) past the 7-day grace
	// period. Metadata captures the failure-state duration and whether
	// the owner DM landed. Read for audit when an operator wonders
	// why the bot is no longer in a guild they previously invited.

	// One-shot DM to the guild owner when Onboarding is enabled AND the

	// Without the heads-up, new members never see the bot's channels
	// because Onboarding hides everything not in the default list until
	// the member opts in via Channels & Roles. Logged once per guild so
	// every restart does not re-nag.

	// ── pairing code DM (FUTURE_PLANS item 63, 2026-06-10) ─────────
	// Logged each time the guild owner is DM'd a one-time claim code on
	// guildCreate (both the fresh-install and re-install branches). Paired
	// with PAIRING_REDEEMED (added in Phase 2) it yields the activation funnel:
	// redemption rate = redeemed / sent, and time-to-redeem from the row
	// timestamps. Not idempotent on purpose: every invite issues a new code and
	// logs a new row.
	PAIRING_CODE_SENT: "pairing_code_sent",
	// ── pairing code redeemed (FUTURE_PLANS item 63, Phase 2, 2026-06-10) ─
	// Logged once when the platform server successfully redeems a code through
	// POST /api/pairing/redeem. Closes the activation funnel: redemption rate
	// is rows-with-PAIRING_REDEEMED divided by rows-with-PAIRING_CODE_SENT
	// for the same guildId, and time-to-redeem is the createdAt delta between
	// the two. Not idempotent on purpose: every successful redemption logs a
	// fresh row, so a re-invite that issues a new code and gets redeemed
	// again shows up as a second redemption (the funnel measures activation
	// events, not unique guilds). Metadata shape matches PAIRING_CODE_SENT
	// — `{ ownerId }` (sourced from the PendingPairing row's ownerUserId
	// field but keyed `ownerId` for cross-event funnel queries) — so the
	// analytics query that joins the two events on guildId can also slice
	// by ownerId without translating field names per event type.
