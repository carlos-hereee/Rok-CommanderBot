	// ── invite URL provenance ─────────────────────────────────────
	// The actual OAuth install URL is composed in @utils/config as
	// `botInviteLink` so dev and prod each serve their own client id.
	// The hardcoded prod URL that used to live here was removed on
	// 2026-04-25 because every reintroduction risks a dev process
	// silently serving prod's install link. If you need the prod URL
	// for documentation, build it from the prod client id (set in the
	// prod env as DISCORD_CLIENT_ID_PROD or DISCORD_CLIENT_ID) and the
	// permissions integer 8.
	//
	// Why permissions=8 (Administrator) ships today: the bot creates a
	// private homebase category with @everyone deny ViewChannel on the
	// admin channel and @everyone deny SendMessages on public channels.
	// Discord's `POST /guilds/.../channels` rejects 50013 when the bot
	// tries to grant itself a permission via member overwrite that
	// @everyone denies in the same call (the bot would gain the
	// permission only AFTER its overwrite is applied, but Discord
	// checks BEFORE). Two ship attempts on 2026-04-25 with the
	// minimum-bits integer (268659792) and various overwrite
	// rearrangements both hit this trap. Administrator bypasses every
	// channel-level overwrite check, including the granting one.
	// Tech-debt item: refactor channel creation to use the bot's
	// integration ROLE overwrite (`guild.members.me.roles.botRole`)
	// which sits in a different permission tier and may avoid the
	// catch-22, then drop back to MIN_PERMISSIONS_DOCS as the install
	// surface.
	// ── minimum perms documentation ──────────────────────────────
	// What:  the explicit list of permissions the bot actually uses,
	//        kept here for install-doc honesty. Even though we ship
	//        Administrator, server owners can audit this list to see
	//        what the bot will actually do. This is also the target
	//        set if/when the integration-role refactor lands and we
	//        can drop Administrator.
	// Who:   anyone reading the bot's README or install guide. Not
	//        consumed by code today.
	// How:   bit names match discord.js PermissionFlagsBits. Sum is
	//        268659792 (the integer we'd use without the Discord
	//        enforcement catch-22).
