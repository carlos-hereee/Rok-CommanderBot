// ── LOG_MESSAGES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// What:  single source of truth for every console.log / console.warn /
//        console.error string the bot emits.
// Who:   every feature module, every route handler, the bot entry point.
// When:  caller imports LOG_MESSAGES and passes the function result or
//        constant to console.*.
// Where: paired with embedContent for user-facing copy. console output
//        lives here; Discord-rendered copy lives in embed-content.ts.
// How:   strings with no interpolation are exported as string constants.
//        strings that take runtime values are exported as arrow functions
//        so the tag prefix and phrasing stay consistent per namespace.
//        error objects are still passed as a second argument to console
//        so stack traces survive.
//
// Usage:
//   import { LOG_MESSAGES } from "@base/constants/log-messages.js";
//   console.error(LOG_MESSAGES.schedule.editFailed(id, guildId), error);
