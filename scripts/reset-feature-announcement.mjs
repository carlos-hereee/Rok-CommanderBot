// Re-arm the per-version feature announcement so the next bot boot reposts it.
//
// Why this exists: postFeatureAnnouncements is idempotent per (guild, version)
// via a BotLog row keyed `feature_announced:<version>`. That is correct for a
// real release (post once, never spam on reboot), but it fights you while you
// iterate on the announcement COPY and redeploy the SAME version: the first
// 1.6.0 boot logs the row, and every later 1.6.0 boot skips. Deleting the row
// lets the corrected copy post again.
//
// Usage (from the bot repo root):
//   node scripts/reset-feature-announcement.mjs            # current package.json version, delete
//   node scripts/reset-feature-announcement.mjs 1.6.0      # explicit version, delete
//   node scripts/reset-feature-announcement.mjs --check    # report only, delete nothing
//
// After it deletes rows, RESTART the bot. The announcement posts on ClientReady,
// not on build, so a rebuild alone never reposts.
